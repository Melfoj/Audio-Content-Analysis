The first part of the programme adds noise to audio signals, while the second part tries to remove most of it.
During testing we found that the harshest and highest noise tones are easier to remove. 
Most of the noise is fairly uniformaly spread throughout the specter and cannot be suppressed without muffling the original audio.
